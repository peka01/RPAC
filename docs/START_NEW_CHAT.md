## ðŸ“‹ Complete Onboarding Prompt

```
I'm working on Beready, a Swedish crisis preparedness app.

Please read these files to get complete context (in this order):

1. docs/NEW_CHAT_ONBOARDING.md - Complete onboarding guide (READ THIS FIRST!)
2. docs/charter.md - Project vision and mission
3. docs/architecture.md - Technical architecture
4. docs/roadmap.md - Current priorities
5. docs/conventions.md - Development rules and UX principles
6. docs/llm_instructions.md - Current development status

After reading, confirm you understand:
- âœ… Olive green colors (NOT blue!)
- âœ… All text must use t() function from sv.json
- âœ… Mobile-first with separate components
- âœ… Use ResourceListView for all lists
- âœ… Development server runs from rpac-web/ directory
- âœ… Document features in dev_notes.md (NOT separate files)

Ready to work on Beready!
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Minimal Context)

If you just need quick help and don't need full project context:

```
I'm working on Beready, a Swedish crisis preparedness app (Next.js + Supabase + TypeScript).

Key rules:
- Olive green colors (#3D4A2B), NOT blue
- All Swedish text via t() function from rpac-web/src/lib/locales/sv.json
- Mobile-first design (separate -mobile.tsx components)
- Use ResourceListView for all lists (rpac-web/src/components/resource-list-view.tsx)
- Dev server: cd rpac-web && npm run dev

[Your specific question or task]
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

### For Long Coding Sessions
Start with full onboarding prompt (above). The AI will have complete context for the entire session.

### For Quick Questions
Use minimal context prompt. Faster for one-off questions that don't need full project knowledge.

### For Feature Work
Always reference `docs/roadmap.md` to check current priorities before starting new work.

### For UX/Design Decisions
Check `docs/conventions.md` first - it has all the established patterns and rules.

### For Database Work
Always check `rpac-web/database/supabase-schema-complete.sql` for table/column names before writing migrations.
