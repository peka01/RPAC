**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Local Community Features

## Overview

Complete integration of resource sharing and help request system into the messaging functionality, enabling community members to share resources, request help, and coordinate assistance through an intuitive interface.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Resource Sharing Service (`resource-sharing-service.ts`)
- **Shared Resources Management**:
  - Create and share resources with specific communities
  - Browse available community resources
  - Request shared resources from other members
  - Mark resources as taken when claimed
  - Remove shared resources (owner only)

- **Help Request System**:
  - Create help requests with urgency levels (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Categorized requests (food, water, medicine, energy, tools, shelter, transport, skills, other)
  - Track request status (open, in_progress, resolved, closed)
  - Priority calculation based on urgency
  - Location-based help coordination

### 2. Resource Sharing Panel Component (`resource-sharing-panel.tsx`)
- **Dual Tab Interface**:
  - **Delade Resurser (Shared Resources)**: Browse and request community resources
  - **Hj√§lpf√∂rfr√•gningar (Help Requests)**: Create and respond to help requests

- **Resource Sharing Features**:
  - Create new shared resource with:
    - Resource name and category
    - Quantity and unit (pieces, kg, L)
    - Availability period (optional)
    - Location information
    - Notes and special instructions
  - Visual category icons (üçû food, üíß water, üíä medicine, ‚ö° energy, üîß tools)

## Conclusion

The resource sharing and help request integration represents a significant milestone in RPAC's Phase 2 development. By seamlessly integrating these features into the existing messaging system, we've created an intuitive and powerful tool for community coordination and mutual aid.

The implementation follows all RPAC design principles:
- Military-grade visual design (olive green color scheme)
- Everyday Swedish communication (warm, helpful text)
- Mobile-first architecture (touch-optimized)
- Progressive disclosure (card-based UI)
- Crisis-ready functionality (urgency levels, emergency coordination)

**Next Steps**: User testing with real communities, gathering feedback for iteration, and considering additional features like resource analytics and push notifications.
