# Cultivation Calendar Progress - Main Dashboard Integration ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Feature**: Integrated cultivation calendar progress into main dashboard card  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Successfully moved and integrated the cultivation calendar progress from the personal dashboard (Individual/Home) to the main dashboard, combining it with the existing cultivation plan card for a unified view.

---

## What Changed

### Before
- Cultivation progress was only visible on Individual → Home page
- Separate card, disconnected from cultivation plan
- Users had to navigate to Individual page to see progress

### After ✅
- Cultivation progress integrated into main dashboard cultivation card
- Unified display showing both plan AND progress
- Visible immediately when user opens the app
- Smart navigation: clicks go to calendar when progress exists, planner otherwise

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Main Dashboard Page** (`rpac-web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

#### Added State Management
```typescript
const [cultivationProgress, setCultivationProgress] = useState<{
  completed: number; 
  total: number; 
  percentage: number
}>({
  completed: 0,
  total: 0,
  percentage: 0
});
```

#### Added Data Loading Function
```typescript
const loadCultivationProgress = async (userId: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('cultivation_calendar')
    .select('is_completed')
    .eq('user_id', userId);
  
  const total = data?.length || 0;
  const completed = data?.filter(item => item.is_completed).length || 0;
  const percentage = total > 0 ? Math.round((completed / total) * 100) : 0;
  
  setCultivationProgress({ completed, total, percentage });
};
```

#### Integrated into Cultivation Card
Added progress section below plan stats:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🌿 Odlingsplan - Min sommarplan  85%  │
│                                         │
│ 12 grödor | 2,450 kr                   │
│ Skapad 2025-09-15                      │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────  │
│ Kalenderframsteg          75%          │
│ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     9/12       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Visual Design

### Integrated Progress Display
- **Location**: Inside cultivation plan card, after plan stats
- **Separator**: Subtle border-top divider
- **Colors**: Matches existing card theme (khaki/sage green)
- **Conditional**: Only shows if `cultivationProgress.total > 0`

### Progress Bar
- Height: 1.5px (thin, subtle)
- Background: `rgba(160, 142, 90, 0.2)` (khaki with transparency)
- Fill: `var(--color-sage)` (sage green)
- Animation: Smooth 500ms transition

### Typography
- Label: Small font-medium
- Percentage: Small font-bold in khaki
- Task count: `{completed}/{total}` format

---

## Smart Navigation

The cultivation card now has intelligent click behavior:

```typescript
onClick={() => {
  const destination = cultivationProgress.total > 0 
    ? '/individual?section=cultivation&subsection=calendar'  // Has tasks → Calendar
    : '/individual?section=cultivation&subsection=ai-planner'; // No tasks → Planner
  router.push(destination);
}}
```

**Logic**:
- **If progress exists** (tasks created) → Navigate to cultivation calendar
- **If no progress** → Navigate to cultivation planner (to create plan)

---

## User Experience Flow

### New User (No Plan)
1. Opens dashboard
2. Sees "Odlingsplanering" card with "Create plan" prompt
3. Clicks card → Goes to planner
4. Creates and saves plan → Calendar entries created
5. Returns to dashboard → Now sees progress!

### Existing User (With Plan)
1. Opens dashboard
2. Sees cultivation plan card with:
   - Self-sufficiency percentage (top right)
   - Plan name and stats
   - **Calendar progress** (bottom section)
3. Clicks card → Goes directly to calendar
4. Completes tasks in calendar
5. Returns to dashboard → Progress updates automatically!

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Dashboard page loads
    ↓
User authenticated
    ↓
loadCultivationPlan(userId) ← Loads plan data
loadCultivationProgress(userId) ← Loads calendar data
    ↓
State updated
    ↓
Card renders with both plan AND progress
    ↓
User clicks card
    ↓
Navigate to calendar OR planner (smart routing)
```

### Performance
