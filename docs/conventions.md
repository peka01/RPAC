## Language and Tone of Voice

### Swedish Language Requirements
- **Primary language**: Swedish for all user-facing content
- **Fallback**: English only for external connectors or technical fallbacks
- **Crisis-adapted tone**: Clear, empathetic, and reassuring communication suitable for emergency situations
- **Localized text integration**: All placeholder strings must be replaced with proper Swedish translations

### Crisis Communication Tone Guidelines
- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language that's easy to understand under stress
- **Empathy**: Show understanding and support in all messages
- **Reassurance**: Provide confidence and hope while being realistic
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on practical steps and solutions
- **Calm authority**: Sound knowledgeable and trustworthy without being alarmist
- **Immediate comprehension**: Messages must be understood instantly, even under duress

### Swedish Technical Terms
- Use proper Swedish technical terminology
- Maintain consistency across all modules
- Adapt English technical terms to Swedish when appropriate
- Use Swedish measurements (meter, liter, kilogram)
- Crisis-specific vocabulary: "krisläge", "beredskap", "ömsesidig hjälp", "samhällsstöd"

## Architecture Principles

- **Offline-first design** in all components
- **Swedish cultural adaptation** for all content
- **Crisis-ready technology** that works when infrastructure fails
- **Modular code** for future integration
- **Privacy defaults** with user control

## Development Workflow

1. **UX-First Planning** - Always start with user needs and experience before technical implementation
2. Always load `/docs/charter.md`, `/docs/architecture.md`, and `/docs/roadmap.md` for context
3. **Check current Sprint priorities** from roadmap.md before starting new work
4. Use Swedish in variable names and UI where possible
5. Document all new features in `/docs/dev_notes.md`
6. Test offline functionality thoroughly
7. Ensure crisis-appropriate messaging throughout

## Revolutionary UX Validation Framework

### The Crisis-Moment Design Test
Before shipping ANY feature, validate against these human-centered criteria:

#### Emotional Intelligence Validation
- [ ] **Does this make a scared person feel more capable and less alone?**
- [ ] **Would this interface work for someone's grandmother during a power outage?**
- [ ] **Does this reduce anxiety rather than create it?**
- [ ] **Is the emotional tone appropriate for Swedish crisis communication culture?**
- [ ] **Does this build community connection rather than technological dependence?**

#### Breakthrough Usability Standards
- [ ] **Can this be used successfully by someone who's never seen it before, within 10 seconds?**
- [ ] **Does this work perfectly with one hand, in the dark, while stressed?**
- [ ] **Is every micro-interaction delightful rather than just functional?**
- [ ] **Does this anticipate user needs before they're expressed?**
- [ ] **Is the cognitive load so low it feels effortless?**

#### Next-Generation Accessibility
- [ ] **Does this work better for disabled users than most "normal" interfaces?**
- [ ] **Is this usable across all ages, abilities, and technical skill levels?**
- [ ] **Does this interface improve with assistive technologies rather than just tolerate them?**
- [ ] **Are we leading accessibility innovation, not just meeting compliance?**

#### Future-Ready Interaction Design
- [ ] **Is this optimized for voice, touch, and gesture interaction?**
- [ ] **Does this work seamlessly across all device sizes and contexts?**
- [ ] **Is the offline experience superior to most online experiences?**
- [ ] **Does this contribute to current development priorities while pushing UX boundaries?**

### UX Excellence Red Flags - STOP and Revolutionize If:

#### Fundamental Design Failures
- **Cognitive burden exists** - Users thinking about interface instead of their goals
- **Stress amplification** - Design that increases rather than reduces anxiety
- **Cultural tone-deafness** - Not feeling authentically Swedish and crisis-appropriate
- **Accessibility afterthought** - Universal design not baked into core experience
- **Information overwhelm** - Too much data without intelligent prioritization

#### Interaction Design Mediocrity
- **Multi-step common actions** - Critical tasks requiring more than one intuitive action
- **Hidden capabilities** - Important features not discoverable through natural exploration
- **Inconsistent mental models** - Same concepts behaving differently across contexts
- **Feedback gaps** - User actions without immediate, clear, and emotionally appropriate responses
- **Emergency failure** - Any critical function that doesn't work under stress/offline conditions

#### Future-Backwards Thinking
- **Device-specific limitations** - Experiences that don't transcend platform boundaries
- **Static information architecture** - Content that doesn't adapt to context and user needs
- **Community isolation** - Individual-focused design that doesn't strengthen social connections
- **Technical exposure** - Users forced to understand system complexity rather than human goals

### The RPAC UX Excellence Standard
*"Every interaction should feel like having a wise, calm, technically capable friend helping during your most challenging moments."*

Our UX success metric isn't usability compliance—it's **human empowerment during crisis**.
