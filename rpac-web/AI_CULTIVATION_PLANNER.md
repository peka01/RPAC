## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface AICultivationPlannerProps {
  userProfile?: any;
  crisisMode?: boolean;
}

// 4-step workflow
type PlanningStep = 'nutrition' | 'planning' | 'grocery' | 'timeline';

// Comprehensive data structures
interface CropData {
  name: string;
  nutrition: NutritionalData;
  growingTime: number;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'expert';
  costPerSeed: number;
  yieldPerSquareMeter: number;
}
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Calorie Needs Calculation
```typescript
const calculateDailyCalorieNeeds = () => {
  const activityMultipliers = {
    sedentary: 1.2, light: 1.375, moderate: 1.55, 
    active: 1.725, very_active: 1.9
  };
  
  const baseCaloricNeeds = {
    adult_male: 1800, adult_female: 1600, 
    child: 1400, elderly: 1500
  };
  
  // Calculate based on household composition and activity
};
```

#### Self-Sufficiency Analysis
```typescript
const calculateSelfSufficiency = () => {
  const dailyNeeds = calculateDailyCalorieNeeds();
  const production = calculateAnnualProduction();
  
  const selfSufficiencyPercent = Math.round(
    (production.dailyCalories / dailyNeeds) * 100
  );
  
  // Generate grocery gap items based on deficit
};
```

#### Grocery Gap Generation
```typescript
const generateGroceryGap = (deficit: number) => {
  const groceryGap: GroceryItem[] = [];
  
  if (deficit > 0) {
    // Add essential items: rice, pasta, lentils
    // Add important items: oats, cooking oil
    // Calculate costs and priorities
  }
};
```
