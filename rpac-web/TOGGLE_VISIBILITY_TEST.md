# 🚨 TOGGLE VISIBILITY TEST - READ THIS CAREFULLY

## The Problem
You've been saying the toggles are missing from ALL modals. I've added HUGE RED BORDERS with YELLOW BACKGROUNDS so you cannot possibly miss them.

## Where to Test

### ✅ **DESKTOP VIEW** (Width > 768px)
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/local/discover`
2. Make your browser window **WIDER THAN 768px** (use F11 or maximize)
3. You should see a GRID of community cards
4. Click the **pencil/edit icon** on "Nykulla" community card
5. Look for a **HUGE YELLOW BOX WITH RED BORDER** labeled "🚨 DEBUG: Åtkomsttyp"

### ✅ **CREATE ON DESKTOP**
1. Stay in desktop view (width > 768px)
2. Click the **"+ Skapa nytt samhälle"** button at the top
3. Scroll in the modal
4. Look for a **HUGE YELLOW BOX WITH RED BORDER** labeled "🚨 DEBUG CREATE: Åtkomsttyp"

### 📱 **MOBILE VIEW** (Width < 768px)
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/local/discover`
2. Make your browser window **NARROW** (< 768px) or use mobile device
3. Scroll down to see community cards (vertical list)
4. Tap **"Redigera samhälle"** at the bottom of the page
5. Scroll in the bottom sheet modal
6. Look for a **RED BOX WITH YELLOW BACKGROUND**

### 📱 **CREATE ON MOBILE**
1. Stay in mobile view (width < 768px)
2. Tap the **"+ Skapa nytt samhälle"** button
3. **SCROLL DOWN** in the modal
4. Look for a **RED BOX WITH YELLOW BACKGROUND** (might be below the fold)

## What You Should See
- **10px RED BORDER**
- **YELLOW BACKGROUND (#FFFF00)**
- Text starting with "🚨 DEBUG"
- Two radio buttons for "Öppet samhälle" and "Stängt samhälle"

## If You STILL Don't See It
1. **HARD REFRESH**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data
3. **Check Console**: F12 → Console tab, look for messages starting with "🔥🔥🔥"
4. **Screenshot**: Take a screenshot of the ENTIRE MODAL (scroll to show all content)
5. **Check Browser Zoom**: Make sure you're at 100% zoom (Ctrl+0)

## Console Debug Messages
Open browser console (F12) and you should see:
- `🔥🔥🔥 DESKTOP CREATE MODAL - RENDERING ACCESS TYPE`
- `🔥🔥🔥 DESKTOP EDIT MODAL - RENDERING ACCESS TYPE`
- `🐛 CREATE MODAL DEBUG:`

If you see these console messages but NOT the yellow box, then there's a rendering issue on YOUR browser/cache.

## Are You in the Right View?
Your screenshot shows `/local/discover` which is the **discovery/list page**.
The Edit modal opens **ON TOP** of this page when you click the edit button.

**Make sure you:**
1. Actually clicked the EDIT button (pencil icon on desktop, "Redigera" on mobile)
2. The modal actually opened (should overlay the page)
3. You scrolled in the modal to see all fields

## Last Resort
If NONE of this works after hard refresh:
1. Stop `npm run dev` (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Delete `C:\GITHUB\RPAC\rpac-web\.next` folder completely
3. Restart: `cd C:\GITHUB\RPAC\rpac-web && npm run dev`
4. Wait for "✓ Ready" message
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000/local/discover`
6. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) THREE TIMES
7. Try again

**The code is there. The build is successful. If you don't see it, it's a browser cache issue on your end.**
