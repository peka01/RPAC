# Checkbox Cleanup - Removed Jumping Animation & Klicka Text

## 🎯 Changes Made

**User Feedback**: "Remove the jumping animation on Klara" and "Remove the 'Klicka' text, should be self explanatory"

**Solution**: Cleaned up the checkbox to be more subtle and self-explanatory.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### **1. Removed Jumping Animation**
- **Before**: `animate-bounce` on completed state
- **After**: Clean, static completed state
- **Result**: More professional and less distracting

### **2. Removed "Klicka" Text**
- **Before**: "○ Klicka" text below incomplete checkbox
- **After**: No text for incomplete state
- **Result**: Self-explanatory design - the greyed-out checkmark is clear enough

### **3. Kept "✓ Klar" Text**
- **Completed State**: Still shows "✓ Klar" for confirmation
- **Incomplete State**: No text needed - the visual design is self-explanatory
- **Result**: Clean, minimal design

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Animation Cleanup**
```typescript
// Before: Jumping animation
className="shadow-lg scale-105 bg-green-500 border-green-600 animate-bounce"

// After: Clean, static state
className="shadow-lg scale-105 bg-green-500 border-green-600"
```

### **Text Cleanup**
```typescript
// Before: Always showed text
{reminder.is_completed ? '✓ Klar' : '○ Klicka'}

// After: Only shows text when completed
{reminder.is_completed ? '✓ Klar' : ''}
```
