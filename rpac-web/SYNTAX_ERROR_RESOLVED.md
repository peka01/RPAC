# Syntax Error Resolution - 2025-10-22

## Problem
`community-discovery-mobile.tsx` was showing syntax errors during compilation:
```
Error: x Expected '</', got 'return'
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by **stale dev server cache** from previous broken versions of the file. The actual file structure is correct:

1. Line 246: Early return for `!userPostalCode` (correctly placed before nested components)
2. Lines 268-359: `FilterSheet` component definition
3. Lines 360-513: `CreateModal` component definition
4. Line 515: Main component return

## Current File Structure (Correct)
```typescript
export function CommunityDiscoveryMobile({ ... }) {
  // State and hooks
  
  // Helper functions
  
  // Early return if no postal code (Line 246)
  if (!userPostalCode) {
    return <div>...</div>;
  }
  
  // Nested component: FilterSheet (Lines 268-359)
  const FilterSheet = () => (...);
  
  // Nested component: CreateModal (Lines 360-513)
  const CreateModal = () => (
    <div>
      <form>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          {/* Form fields */}
        </div>
        <button type="submit">...</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
  
  // Main return (Line 515)
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Main component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Resolution
1. Deleted `.next` cache folder
2. Restarted `npm run dev`
3. File now compiles successfully

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - The file structure is correct and the error was due to stale cache.

---

**Note**: Both `/local` (using these components) and `/local/discover` (using its own inline component) are actively used in the application and should be kept.
