## ❓ Common Questions

### "Can I use my logo as banner?"
**Yes!** Upload it as a custom image. For best results:
- Make it part of a full banner design (not just logo alone)
- Or use gradient + put logo elsewhere on page

### "The banner looks dark/too bright"
**Try different gradient:**
- Too dark → Try "Varm Oliv" or "Olivgrön Gradient"
- Too bright → Try "Mörk Oliv"

**Or upload custom image with better lighting**

### "My image looks bad"
**Common fixes:**
- Try different image (higher resolution)
- Check if image is too dark (we add overlay)
- Try landscape format instead of portrait
- Use gradient instead

### "I made a mistake, how do I undo?"
**Easy:**
1. Click banner again
2. Choose previous option
3. Save

**Or:**
- Changes aren't permanent until you click "Spara"
- Just close modal without saving

### "The gradient changed but looks wrong"
**Try:**
1. Refresh page
