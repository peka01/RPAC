**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY  
**Version:** 1.0

## üéØ Executive Summary

A complete user management strategy has been implemented for RPAC, supporting a future business model with tiered user access and community management. The system allows for:

1. **Three-tier user system**: Individual, Community Manager, Super Admin
2. **Community access control**: Open (√∂ppet) vs. Closed (st√§ngt) communities
3. **Membership approval workflow**: Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected
4. **License management foundation**: Ready for future paid subscriptions
5. **Super Admin dashboard**: Complete backend management interface

## üìä System Architecture

### **User Tier System**

```typescript
enum UserTier {
  INDIVIDUAL = 'individual',           // Basic access (future: paid license)
  COMMUNITY_MANAGER = 'community_manager',  // Can create communities (future: premium license)
  SUPER_ADMIN = 'super_admin'          // System administrator
}
```

**Permissions by Tier:**

| Feature | Individual | Community Manager | Super Admin |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| View own profile | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Join communities | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Create communities | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Manage communities | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ (own) | ‚úÖ (all) |
| Upgrade user tiers | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Access super-admin panel | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

### **Community Access Control**

```typescript
enum CommunityAccessType {
  OPEN = '√∂ppet',      // Anyone can join immediately
  CLOSED = 'st√§ngt'    // Requires admin approval
}
```

### **Membership Workflow**

```
User Requests ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí Admin Reviews ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED
                                      ‚Üì
                                  BANNED (if needed)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Migrations

**Run these migrations in order in Supabase SQL Editor:**

1. `rpac-web/database/add-user-tier-system.sql`
2. `rpac-web/database/add-community-access-control.sql`
3. `rpac-web/database/add-membership-approval-workflow.sql`
4. `rpac-web/database/add-license-history-table.sql`
5. `rpac-web/database/add-admin-utility-functions.sql`
6. `rpac-web/database/update-rls-policies-for-tiers.sql`

**Safety:** All migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely).

## üîí Security Implementation

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**

- **Tier upgrades**: Only super admins can change user tiers

### **Database Functions**

Created secure, reusable functions:

- `get_pending_membership_requests()` - Get pending requests for a community
- `approve_membership_request()` - Approve with auto-notification
- `reject_membership_request()` - Reject with reason and notification
- `ban_community_member()` - Ban member from community
- `upgrade_user_tier()` - Change user permission level
- `get_managed_communities()` - Get communities user manages
- `get_all_users()` - Super admin only - list all users
- `get_community_statistics()` - Community analytics
