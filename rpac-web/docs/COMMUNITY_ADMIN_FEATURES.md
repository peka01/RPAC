# Community Admin Features Documentation

## 🎨 UX Design Highlights

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Hero Cards (Olive Green #5C6B47)** - Admin section header
2. **White Cards** - Tab content areas
3. **Status Badges** - Color-coded indicators (green for approved, orange for pending)

### User Flow
```
Mitt samhälle → Admin Badge (visible only to admins) → Admin Section
                                                      ├─ Väntande ansökningar (Pending)
                                                      ├─ Medlemmar (Members)
                                                      ├─ Inställningar (Settings)
                                                      └─ Hemsida (Homepage)
```

### Mobile Optimization

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. **`CommunityAdminSection.tsx`**
   - Main admin dashboard component
   - Tab-based navigation
   - State management for pending requests, members, and settings
   - Database integration via Supabase RPC functions

### Components Modified
1. **`community-dashboard.tsx`** (Desktop)
   - Added admin section after Quick Actions
   - Only visible when `isAdmin === true`

2. **`community-hub-mobile-enhanced.tsx`** (Mobile)
   - Integrated admin section in Community Detail View
   - Placed after Homespace admin card

3. **`sv.json`** (Localization)
   - Added `community_admin` section with 80+ translations
   - All strings properly localized

### Database Functions Used
```sql
-- Fetch pending membership requests
get_pending_membership_requests(p_community_id UUID)

-- Approve membership
approve_membership_request(
  p_membership_id UUID,
  p_reviewer_id UUID
)

-- Reject membership
reject_membership_request(
  p_membership_id UUID,
  p_reviewer_id UUID,
  p_reason TEXT
)

-- Update community settings
UPDATE local_communities
SET community_name, description, access_type, 
    auto_approve_members, is_public
WHERE id = communityId
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Admin Check
- Admin status verified via `communityService.isUserAdmin(communityId, userId)`
- Database-level security with `SECURITY DEFINER` functions
- Only users with `role IN ('admin', 'moderator')` can:
  - Approve/reject membership requests
  - Change community settings
  - View admin section

### Authorization Flow
```
User → Community Membership → Role Check → Admin Section Access
                                   ├─ admin → Full access
                                   ├─ moderator → Full access (future: limited)
                                   └─ member → No access
```

---

## 📊 User Roles & Hierarchy

### Global User Tiers (user_profiles.user_tier)
1. **`individual`** - Regular user
2. **`community_manager`** - Can create communities (global permission)
3. **`super_admin`** - Full system access

### Community-Specific Roles (community_memberships.role)
1. **`admin`** - Full community management
2. **`moderator`** - Can approve members (future: limited settings)
3. **`member`** - Standard member access

### Important Distinction
- A user can be a `community_manager` (global tier) AND an `admin` in multiple communities
- A user can be an `admin` in Community A and a `member` in Community B
- The admin section only appears when the user is an `admin` or `moderator` for the **active community**

---

## 🎯 Access Type Behavior

### Öppet Samhälle (Open Community)
- `access_type = 'öppet'`
- `auto_approve_members = true`
- Users instantly become members upon joining
- No admin approval needed
- **Pending Requests tab will be empty** (by design)

### Stängt Samhälle (Closed Community)
- `access_type = 'stängt'`
- `auto_approve_members = false`
- Join requests require admin approval
- Users wait in pending state
- **Pending Requests tab shows waiting applicants**

---

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Database Updates
1. ✅ Admin utility functions already deployed (`add-admin-utility-functions.sql`)
2. ✅ `get_all_users` function fixed (`FIX_GET_ALL_USERS_FINAL.sql`)

### Frontend Deployment
```bash
cd rpac-web
npm run build
# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Semi-Military Visual + Everyday Swedish Text
- **Visual**: Clean, direct, olive green aesthetic

- **Icons**: Clear, intuitive symbols
- **Spacing**: Professional, focused

### Card-Based Progressive Disclosure
```
Summary Card → Tab Navigation → Detailed View → Action Buttons
```

### Color Coding
- **Green (#556B2F)** - Approved/Success
- **Orange (#B8860B)** - Warning/Pending
- **Olive Green (#3D4A2B)** - Primary actions
- **Gray** - Secondary/Cancel actions

## 📞 Admin Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Can a user be admin of multiple communities?**
A: Yes! A user can be an admin in any number of communities. The admin section adapts to show controls for the currently active community.

**Q: What's the difference between community_manager and admin?**
A: 
- `community_manager` = Global tier, allows **creating** communities
- `admin` = Community-specific role, allows **managing** a specific community
- You can be a community_manager without being an admin of any community
- You can be an admin without having community_manager tier

**Q: Why don't I see pending requests in my open community?**
A: Open communities (`access_type = 'öppet'`) automatically approve all members. The pending requests tab will be empty by design. Switch to `access_type = 'stängt'` if you want to review applicants.

**Q: How do I change my community from open to closed?**
A: Go to **Mitt samhälle → Administratörsverktyg → Inställningar → Åtkomstkontroll**, select "Stängt samhälle", and click "Spara ändringar".
