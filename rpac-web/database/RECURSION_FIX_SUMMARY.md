# RLS Policy Recursion Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
Console error: **Supabase help_requests insert error: {}** (empty error object)
- Root cause: PostgreSQL error 42P17 (infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'community_memberships')
- Affected operations: INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE on `help_requests` table
- Cascading failures: Community hub, help requests, resource sharing features blocked

## Root Cause Analysis
Multiple migration files created RLS policies with self-referential queries:

```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEMATIC PATTERN (found in 3 migration files)
CREATE POLICY "..." ON help_requests
  FOR SELECT/INSERT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM community_memberships  -- Self-reference during permission check
      WHERE community_id = help_requests.community_id
      AND user_id = auth.uid()
      [AND membership_status = 'approved']
    )
  );
```

When Supabase evaluates this policy, it:
1. Tries to INSERT into help_requests
2. Policy checks if user is in community_memberships
3. But community_memberships also has RLS policies
4. Those policies may reference help_requests → infinite loop
5. PostgreSQL detects recursion → error 42P17 → empty error object

## Solution Applied
Simplified all RLS policies to use only **direct auth checks** instead of recursive queries.

### Files Modified

#### 1. **supabase-schema-complete.sql** (Already Fixed)
- Lines 425-437: help_requests policies
- Lines 392-397: community_memberships policies
- Lines 377-383: local_communities policies

**Changes:**
```sql
-- ✅ FIXED PATTERN
CREATE POLICY "Users can view help requests" ON help_requests
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create help requests" ON help_requests
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id AND community_id IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own help requests" ON help_requests
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### 2. **add-missing-user-profile-columns.sql** (JUST FIXED)
- Lines 126-138: help_requests policies

**Changed from:** Recursive EXISTS on community_memberships
**Changed to:** Simple `auth.uid() = user_id` checks

#### 3. **update-rls-policies-for-tiers.sql** (JUST FIXED)
- Lines 189-211: help_requests policies (had "Approved members" variant with even more complex recursion)
- Lines 245-289: messages policies (also had recursive community_memberships checks)

**Changed from:** Complex approval status checks with EXISTS on community_memberships
**Changed to:** Simple direct owner/sender checks

### Policy Architecture

#### Old Pattern (Broken)
```
RLS Policy Layer                    Database Layer
    ↓                                    ↓
Policy checks membership ────────→ Queries community_memberships
    ↓                                    ↓
community_memberships has RLS ────→ Could trigger help_requests checks
    ↑                                    ↑
    └────────────────────────────────────┘
           INFINITE LOOP (42P17 ERROR)
```

#### New Pattern (Fixed)
```
RLS Policy Layer                    Database Layer
    ↓                                    ↓
Policy checks auth.uid() ────────→ No recursive table queries
(Simple database call)
    ✓ No infinite loops
    ✓ Application layer validates business logic
    ✓ Better performance (fewer DB queries)
```

## Security Note
The application layer is now responsible for validating:
- ✅ User is member of community (checked before calling createHelpRequest)
- ✅ Approval status if required (application-level enforcement)
- ✅ Permission levels (admin vs member)

RLS still provides baseline protection:
- ✅ Users can only view/modify their own records
- ✅ Enforces `community_id IS NOT NULL` on help_requests INSERT
- ✅ Users cannot modify other users' requests

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup current Supabase data** (recommended)

2. **Apply the fixed policies** - Choose ONE approach:

   **Option A: Drop and recreate schema** (Complete reset)
   ```sql
   -- Execute entire supabase-schema-complete.sql
   -- This overwrites all policies with the fixed versions
   ```

   **Option B: Apply individual fix files** (Incremental)
   ```sql
   -- Execute in this order:
   -- 1. fix-all-recursive-policies.sql
   -- 2. add-missing-user-profile-columns.sql
   -- 3. update-rls-policies-for-tiers.sql
   ```

3. **Restart dev server**
   ```powershell
   cd rpac-web
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Verify fixes**
   - Check browser console - no 42P17 errors
   - GET `/api/community-memberships` returns 200 (not 500)
   - Create test help request - should succeed with data (not empty error)
   - Community hub loads without cascading failures

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] No PostgreSQL 42P17 errors in console
- [ ] help_requests INSERT succeeds with returned data
- [ ] help_requests SELECT returns all records for user
- [ ] community_memberships CRUD operations work
- [ ] Community hub loads and displays members
- [ ] Help requests composer works end-to-end
- [ ] Messages can be sent without errors

## Testing Commands (Terminal)

```powershell
# Check for active recursion errors in logs
# (Monitor browser console while performing these)

# Create help request via UI
# → Should see data returned, not empty error object

# Load community details
# → Should see member list without 500 error

# Send message in community
# → Should succeed without RLS policy errors
```
