### If Successful, Mark Complete:

- [ ] Date completed: _______________
- [ ] All features working: YES / NO
- [ ] Dev team notified: YES / NO
- [ ] Users can resume work: YES / NO

## Troubleshooting (If Issues Occur)

### Issue: Still seeing 42P17 error

**Solution 1: Clear browser cache**
- [ ] DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Clear site data
- [ ] Reload page
- [ ] Test again

**Solution 2: Restart dev server**
```powershell
# Stop with Ctrl+C
# Then:
cd rpac-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Solution 3: Check Supabase execution**
- [ ] Go to Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Run query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'help_requests';
  ```
- [ ] Look for policies with new names (without "Approved members")
- [ ] ‚úÖ Should see: "Users can view help requests..."
- [ ] ‚úÖ Should NOT see: "Approved members can..."

### Issue: Help request creates but then disappears

Likely cause: Cascading RLS policy still present

- [ ] Go to Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Search for: "Approved members can create"
- [ ] If found: Apply migration again carefully
- [ ] Ask: Did the full SQL run successfully?

### Issue: Empty error object still appearing

**Check database logs:**
- [ ] Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
- [ ] Look for recent policy errors
- [ ] Copy error message
- [ ] Share with development team

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**ONLY use if catastrophic failure:**

```sql
-- Restore from Supabase backup (automatic daily backups available)
-- Contact Supabase support if needed
```

Steps:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Click: "Backups"
3. Select: Backup from today before migration
4. Click: "Restore"
5. Confirm: Yes, restore
