-- URGENT FIX: 403 ERRORS & RLS POLICY VIOLATIONS
-- =============================================
-- This fixes the 403 errors when joining communities
-- AND the RLS policy violations on homespace_activity_log
-- Created: 2025-01-27
-- Issue: 403 Forbidden + RLS policy violations
-- Fix: Complete RLS policy overhaul

-- =============================================
-- STEP 1: FIX COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIPS RLS POLICIES
-- =============================================

-- Drop all existing policies to start fresh

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can request community membership" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can request to join communities" ON community_memberships;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view community memberships" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all memberships" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view relevant memberships" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all community memberships" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view memberships" ON community_memberships;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage membership requests" ON community_memberships;

  );

-- SELECT POLICY: All authenticated users can view memberships
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view memberships"

-- UPDATE POLICY: Admins can manage membership requests

-- =============================================
-- STEP 2: FIX HOMESPACE_ACTIVITY_LOG RLS POLICIES
-- =============================================

-- Drop existing policies

-- UPDATE POLICY: Only system can update activities
CREATE POLICY "System can update activities"

  );

-- DELETE POLICY: Only system can delete activities
CREATE POLICY "System can delete activities"
  ON homespace_activity_log FOR DELETE
  USING (
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- =============================================
-- STEP 3: VERIFY ALL POLICIES WERE CREATED
