-- =============================================
-- FIX: Member Name Logging in Activity Feed
-- =============================================
-- This fixes the issue where member names aren't being displayed
-- in the activity feed for member_joined activities

-- First, let's check what's currently in the database
SELECT 
  'Current member activities:' as status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM homespace_activity_log 
WHERE activity_type = 'member_joined';

-- Update existing member_joined activities to include proper user names
-- This will fix any existing activities that don't have proper names
UPDATE homespace_activity_log 
SET user_name = COALESCE(
  (SELECT COALESCE(up.display_name, CONCAT(up.first_name, ' ', up.last_name), 'Ny medlem')
   FROM user_profiles up 
   WHERE up.user_id = homespace_activity_log.user_id),
  'Ny medlem'
)
WHERE activity_type = 'member_joined' 
  AND (user_name IS NULL OR user_name = 'Anonym anv√§ndare' OR user_name = '');

-- Update the description to include the user name properly
UPDATE homespace_activity_log 
SET description = user_name || ' gick med i samh√§llet'
WHERE activity_type = 'member_joined' 
  AND user_name IS NOT NULL 
  AND user_name != 'Anonym anv√§ndare'
  AND user_name != '';
