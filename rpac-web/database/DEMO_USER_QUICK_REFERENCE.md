## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Demo user not found"
→ Click "Log in as Demo" to create it automatically

### "Invalid login credentials" / Wrong password
→ **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Reset password in Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to: Authentication → Users
   - Find: demo@beready.se
   - Click: ... menu → Reset Password → Set: demo123

→ **Option 2**: Delete and recreate user
```sql
\i fix-demo-password.sql
-- Then click "Log in as Demo" to recreate with correct password
```

### "User already registered" error
→ User exists with wrong password, use Option 1 or 2 above

### "Can't update profile"
→ Check RLS policies: `SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'demo@beready.se');`

### "Can't share resources"
→ Run setup script to create demo community and membership

### "No data showing"
→ Run `setup-demo-user.sql` to create sample data

## 💡 Tips

- The demo user is a **real user** in Supabase Auth
- All data follows **normal RLS policies**
- Safe to delete and recreate anytime
- Use soft reset between tests to keep the same user ID
- Use hard reset if you need a completely fresh start
