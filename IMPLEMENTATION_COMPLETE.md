## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why Three Tiers?
- **Scalable** - Easy to add more tiers in future
- **Clear permissions** - Each tier has distinct capabilities
- **Business model ready** - Individual = basic, Community Manager = premium

### Why Öppet/Stängt Instead of Roles?
- **User-friendly** - Clear Swedish terms everyone understands
- **Simple workflow** - Binary choice, easy to explain
- **Mobile-friendly** - Works perfectly on small screens

### Why Database-Level Security?
- **Bulletproof** - Permissions enforced even if frontend is bypassed
- **Performance** - No need to check permissions in application code
- **Audit-ready** - All access logged at database level

## 🔮 Future Business Model Integration

### When You're Ready for Paid Licenses:

**Step 1: Add Payment Provider**
```typescript
// In environment variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Step 2: Create Pricing**
- Individual: 49 SEK/månad
- Community Manager: 149 SEK/månad

**Step 3: Add Webhook Handler**
The `license_history` table is ready. Just connect Stripe webhooks to:
1. Create license_history entry on payment
2. Set `license_expires_at = NOW() + 30 days`
3. Set `is_license_active = true`

**Step 4: Add Expiration Check**
Create a daily cron job to:
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles 
SET is_license_active = false 
WHERE license_expires_at < NOW();
```
