# CI/CD Optimization Migration Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Review Changes
- [ ] Read `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` for overview
- [ ] Review `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` changes
- [ ] Check `rpac-web/next.config.js` (swcMinify removed)
- [ ] Check `rpac-web/package.json` (10 packages updated)
- [ ] Understand why Next.js is locked to 15.5.2 (see docs)

### âœ… Local Environment Setup
```bash
cd rpac-web
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

- [ ] Dependencies install successfully (no errors)
- [ ] No `--legacy-peer-deps` warnings
- [ ] `package-lock.json` created/updated

### âœ… Local Testing
```bash
# Test build
npm run build

# Test Cloudflare build
npm run pages:build

# Test linting
npm run lint

# Optional: Test preview
npm run preview
```

- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Cloudflare build creates `.vercel/output/static`
- [ ] Lint runs clean (or acceptable warnings)
- [ ] Preview works (if tested)

### âœ… Git Preparation
```bash
git status
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git add rpac-web/next.config.js
git add rpac-web/package.json
git add rpac-web/package-lock.json
git add *.md

git commit -m "Optimize CI/CD: faster builds, caching, updated dependencies

- Split lint and deploy into separate GitHub Actions jobs
- Add npm module and .next/cache caching
- Eliminate double builds (Next.js + next-on-pages)
- Remove --legacy-peer-deps requirement
- Update 10 packages to latest compatible versions
- Remove deprecated swcMinify from next.config.js
- Add comprehensive documentation

Performance: ~50% faster builds, 80% cleaner logs"
```

- [ ] All modified files staged
- [ ] Commit message written
- [ ] Ready to push

## Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

- [ ] Push successful
- [ ] GitHub Actions triggered

### âœ… Monitor GitHub Actions
Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RPAC/actions`

**Job 1: Lint & Type Check**
- [ ] Checkout step passes
- [ ] Setup Node (with cache) passes
- [ ] npm ci completes quickly (~30-45 sec with cache)
- [ ] ESLint check passes
- [ ] TypeScript check passes
- [ ] Overall job status: âœ… Green

**Job 2: Build & Deploy** (only runs if lint passes)
- [ ] Checkout step passes
- [ ] Setup Node (with cache) passes
- [ ] npm ci completes quickly (~30-45 sec with cache)
- [ ] Cache .next/cache (check restore key)
- [ ] Build Next.js application completes
- [ ] Build for Cloudflare Pages completes
- [ ] Verify build output shows green checkmarks
- [ ] Deploy to Cloudflare Pages succeeds
- [ ] Overall job status: âœ… Green

### âœ… Check Deployment Logs
Look for these indicators of success:

**Cache Performance:**
```
Cache restored from key: ...
Cache saved with key: ...
```

**Build Output:**
```
âœ… .vercel/output/static directory exists
ðŸ“¦ Output size: [should be reasonable]
```

**Deployment:**
```
âœ… Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages!
```

- [ ] Cache is working (restore messages present)
- [ ] Build output size is reasonable
- [ ] Deployment succeeded

### âœ… Verify Cloudflare Pages
Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Pages â†’ rpac-web

- [ ] New deployment appears in list
- [ ] Deployment status: Success
- [ ] Build time improved (compare to previous)
- [ ] No errors in deployment logs

### âœ… Test Live Site
Visit: `https://rpac-web.pages.dev` (or your custom domain)

**Critical Functionality:**
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Authentication works (Supabase)
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Images/icons load (lucide-react)
- [ ] Theme switching works (next-themes)
- [ ] AI features work (@google/generative-ai)
- [ ] Markdown renders (react-markdown)

**Performance Check:**
- [ ] Initial load time acceptable
- [ ] Page transitions smooth
- [ ] No obvious performance regressions

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Compare Build Times
Check previous vs current deployment in GitHub Actions:

| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Total time | ___ min | ___ min | [ ] Improved |
| Dependency install | ___ min | ___ sec | [ ] Improved |
| Build time | ___ min | ___ min | [ ] Improved |
| Lint feedback | After build | Before build | [ ] Improved |

### âœ… Verify Caching
Second deployment (make a small change and push):

- [ ] Cache restored successfully
- [ ] Build time even faster (cache hit)
- [ ] npm ci completes in ~10-20 seconds

### âœ… Test Lint Failure Scenario
Make a deliberate lint error and push:

```javascript
// Add to any .tsx file temporarily
const unused = "This will trigger ESLint error";
```

- [ ] Lint job fails quickly (~2 min)
- [ ] Deploy job is skipped (doesn't run)
- [ ] Faster feedback than before

Fix and verify:
- [ ] Remove the error and push
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Deploy proceeds

### âœ… Documentation Cleanup (Optional)
After successful migration:

- [ ] Archive old deployment notes (if any)
- [ ] Keep or remove temporary documentation:
  - `CI_CD_OPTIMIZATION.md` (detailed reference)
  - `PACKAGE_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md` (detailed reference)
  - `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` (quick reference)
  - `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` (this file - can delete)
  - `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.txt` (overview - can delete)

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### If Deployment Fails:

**Option 1: Quick Revert**
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

**Option 2: Manual Deploy Previous Version**
```bash
git checkout <previous-working-commit>
cd rpac-web
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build
npm run pages:build
npx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name=rpac-web
```

### Rollback Checklist:
- [ ] Revert committed and pushed
- [ ] Old workflow running again
- [ ] Site working correctly
- [ ] Team notified of rollback
- [ ] Issue documented for investigation

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: npm ci fails with peer dependency error
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Regenerate package-lock.json"
git push
```

### Issue: Cache not restoring in GitHub Actions
**Solution:** 
- First build won't have cache (expected)
- Second build should restore cache
- Check cache key in workflow logs

### Issue: Lint job has too many warnings
**Options:**
1. Fix the warnings (recommended)
2. Temporarily adjust `--max-warnings` threshold in workflow
3. Suppress specific rules in `.eslintrc.json`

### Issue: Build time not improved
**Causes:**
- First build (no cache yet)
- Many file changes (cache invalidated)
- Check cache restore in logs

### Issue: Deploy succeeds but site broken
**Debug:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Cloudflare Pages logs
3. Verify environment variables in Cloudflare settings
4. Compare `.vercel/output/static` contents with previous build
